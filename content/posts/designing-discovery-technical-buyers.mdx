# How I Design Discovery for Technical Buyers

After leading 30+ discovery sessions with technical teams, I've learned that the key to successful technical sales isn't just understanding the product—it's understanding the people and their real problems.

## The Problem with Traditional Discovery

Most discovery sessions follow a predictable pattern: feature demos, capability questions, and technical requirements gathering. But this approach misses the mark because it focuses on *what* they need, not *why* they need it.

Technical buyers are often skeptical of sales processes. They've been burned by overpromising vendors and generic solutions that don't fit their specific environment. They need to see that you understand their world.

## My Discovery Framework

### 1. Start with Context, Not Capabilities

Before diving into technical details, I always ask about their current environment and challenges:

- "Walk me through your current testing process"
- "What's working well in your current setup?"
- "What keeps you up at night when it comes to QA?"

This establishes trust and shows I'm interested in their success, not just selling them something.

### 2. Map the Decision-Making Process

Technical buyers rarely make decisions in isolation. I always ask:

- "Who else is involved in evaluating solutions like this?"
- "What does the approval process look like?"
- "What would need to happen for this to move forward?"

Understanding the full decision-making landscape helps me tailor my approach to each stakeholder.

### 3. Focus on Outcomes, Not Features

Instead of asking "Do you need automated test generation?", I ask:

- "How much time does your team spend writing test cases?"
- "What would it mean for your business if you could reduce that time by 50%?"
- "How do you currently measure the effectiveness of your testing?"

This helps me understand the business impact and build a compelling case for change.

### 4. Validate with Data

I always ask for specific metrics and examples:

- "Can you share some numbers on your current test execution time?"
- "What's your current defect escape rate?"
- "How many test cases do you typically write per sprint?"

This gives me concrete data to work with and shows I'm serious about solving their specific problems.

## The Art of Technical Storytelling

Once I understand their context, I tell stories that resonate with their experience. Instead of generic demos, I create scenarios that mirror their actual workflows.

For example, if they're dealing with flaky tests, I don't just show our test stability features. I walk through a scenario where their CI/CD pipeline is failing due to unreliable tests, and show how our solution would prevent that specific problem.

## Building Trust Through Expertise

Technical buyers want to work with people who understand their challenges. I always:

- Share relevant industry insights and trends
- Discuss common pitfalls I've seen in similar environments
- Offer specific recommendations based on their context
- Be honest about limitations and trade-offs

## The Follow-Through

Discovery doesn't end when the meeting ends. I always:

- Send a detailed summary of what we discussed
- Provide specific next steps and timelines
- Share relevant resources or documentation
- Follow up on any questions or concerns they raised

## Key Takeaways

1. **Context before capabilities** - Understand their world before pitching solutions
2. **Outcomes over features** - Focus on business impact, not technical features
3. **Stories over demos** - Use scenarios that mirror their actual workflows
4. **Expertise builds trust** - Share insights and be honest about limitations
5. **Follow through matters** - The meeting is just the beginning of the relationship

The goal isn't to sell them something—it's to help them solve a real problem. When you approach discovery with that mindset, the sale becomes a natural outcome of providing genuine value.
