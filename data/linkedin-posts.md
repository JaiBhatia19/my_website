AI is everywhere right now.

But let's be honest, most of us don't actually understand what's going on under the hood. Not because we don't care, but because not everyone has hours to sit through dense, technical lectures?

So I built myself a shortcut.

Using NotebookLM, I condensed some of the best AI fundamentals videos into a 30-minute podcast you can listen to on a walk or commute, and an 8-minute video for when you just need the highlights.

In under 40 minutes, you'll finally get how this stuff works:
Neural networks and back-propagation, transformers and attention, how LLMs actually store and retrieve facts. No hype. No jargon. Just clear, practical explanations. I'm sharing it because I know how overwhelming AI hype can feel, especially when you're busy and trying to stay relevant in a world that moves way too fast.

If you check it out, drop a comment with what clicked for you or what you want me to unpack next.

Learning shouldn't feel like homework. It should feel like unlocking cheat codes for your career.

Everyone's hyped about AI, but Olivia Gambelin's talk on "Elevating the Human in the Equation: Responsible Testing in the Age of AI." was a good reminder that real progress in testing/AI still comes from humans making smart, responsible choices. Tech is cool, but people > promises.

I said "It doesn't work."

Chatbot said "Glad I could assist you."

Turns out, language modeling without grounding is just vibes at scale.

The real frontier isn't bigger models, it's models that understand.
